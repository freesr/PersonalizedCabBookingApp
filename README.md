The aim of this Android app project is to develop a personalized cab booking application that enhances the transportation experience for users. The app focuses on providing real-time location tracking, user profiles, manual status management, fare calculation, ride history, and scheduling capabilities.

In the first step, the app leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to establish live location tracking between the driver and the user. This ensures that users can monitor the driver's location in real-time, enabling a seamless pickup experience.

The second step involves creating user profiles and granting them access to view the live location of their assigned driver. This feature adds transparency and allows users to stay informed about the whereabouts of their cab.

Next, a manual status feature is implemented to allow the driver to indicate their availability. If the driver is online, users can book a cab and reserve a time slot based on their planned trip journey. This flexibility enables users to plan their travel in advance and secure a confirmed booking.

The fourth step involves developing an algorithm to determine the cab fare based on factors such as distance, time, and additional charges. Users can view the total fare for their trip and also access their ride history to track their expenses and previous bookings.

Lastly, the app incorporates a scheduling feature that enables users to schedule a cab for a specific time slot, particularly for round trips. The system manages the schedule and blocks the corresponding slot, ensuring availability and avoiding conflicts in booking.

Overall, this Android app project combines live location tracking, user profiles, manual status management, fare calculation, ride history, and scheduling capabilities to provide users with a personalized and convenient cab booking experience.
