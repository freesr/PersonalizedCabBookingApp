In this assignment, you will build a login system on your Android device. The login system will
allow the following.
1. A registration page: You will register the user using her email, login id, password, and
name. The registration page should also allow putting in the confirmation code and
finishing the registration process.
2. A login page: The user should login using their login id and password. If the login success
the system should print a Toast stating, ‘Login Successful’. If the login is not successful,
the system should print a Toast stating ‘Login not successful and provide a reason)
3. A password reset page where the password can be reset for a specific username or login
ID.
You will have to write login APIs (registration, confirmation, login, and password reset) in AWS
using a combination of Lambda functions, API Gateway, and AWS Cognito
